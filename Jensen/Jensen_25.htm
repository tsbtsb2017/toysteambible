Notes:   1937 Jensen #25 with riveted boiler and large cylinder bearing 4 bolt pattern on face, solid cast iron engine, cast flywheel, solid pine base, electrically heated.  The second rarest Jensen I have. 1930's Jensens bore robins egg blue paint supposedly hand applied by Mrs. Jensen at the kitchen table.

Notes:   Late 1930's Jensen #25 with riveted boiler and predating Jensen reversing linkages, solid cast iron engine, cast flywheel, solid pine base, electrically heated.  A bit later version of the '4 bolt' Jensen #25, bearing smaller cylinder and before Jensen began installing reversing linkages.  Robins egg blue era and first with electric cord run out the base of the chimney stack vs. front of firebox.

Notes:   Early 1960's Jensen #25, solid cast iron engine, cast flywheel, plywood base, proper Stevensons reversing linkage, electrically heated. My first Jensen purchase which led me to collect most of the cast iron base/wood versions of their collector engine line.  Locomotive like engine components and tight machining tolerances are in a class of their own within the toy steam world...almost machinist built quality...

Notes:   This is an example of a Jensen Style 25 cast model.   This Jensen engine was very popular among collectors and hobbyist and was kept in production longer than any other Jensen model.  This particular Jensen, shown here, has been in exhibition for many many years, behind glass in a museum. The museum retired this exhibit and I was fortunate to buy it. It was believed to be unfired.
