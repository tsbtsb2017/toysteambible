<h1>Wells History</h1>

<p>
In 1972 Kenneth Wells, a teacher at Manor Court School, Portsmouth, England, wrote three text books under the general title of Step by Step Metalwork. Book three only contained two projects. How to make a stationary toy steam model and how to make a toy steam traction engine.<br><br>Unfortunately, by the late 1980's, changes in both Health and Safety Laws and in the education system's curriculum requirements meant that these models stopped being made.<br><br>These models were made as school projects which means they are made to very differing standards and finish. They are still fairly easy to find on ebay and are both great fun and a good addition to a toy steam collection.
