Notes:   I bought this bottle framed steam engine recently on an online auction. It is missing the upper half (cylinder, piston, steam chest, etc) and has no name or markings on it. I have seen and own many model steam engines but have never seen one like this before and am hoping to find information about it. It was bought from a guy in New Jersey and he did not tell me anything more. Unusual flywheel not flat surface but rounded, 3 inch diameter. Piston stroke is 1 1/4 inches. Belt pulley has three sizes. As is it is 6 inches tall and where the piston attached is 1 3/32 across. I seem to think it is from an old popcorn cart possibly but I don't know. Any information on this engine would be great, please contact subtsb@gmail.com with any info thanks.
