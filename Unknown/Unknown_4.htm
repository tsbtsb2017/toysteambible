Notes:   I have no idea what engine this is but may be a bing. it has no model stickers or makers badges or could it be a home made engine. <p> Feedback recieved from Pete King: Reference TSB Entry 574, owner Toby Caunt. Although I cannot give you a maker's name, these engines are made in Britain by an individual and normally have a sticker on them stating 'Made in Great Britain' and also displaying a Union Jack. I have a very similar engine but without the chimney/condensator. The person who makes them sells them on ebay, which is where I purchased mine from. Unforunately he does not have any on offer at the moment or I could tell you where he is based. Because I purchased mine a few years ago I have not been able to find the paperwork but if I do manage to uncover any further info I will let you know.</p>  Update:   Made in the UK by ebay seller stephens6949 based in Congleton (Real name: Steve Smith)
