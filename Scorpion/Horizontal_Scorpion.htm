Notes:   This was the first complete steam plant that Model Engineering produced. The boiler is a simple affair. It is made from a rolled sheet of brass with just a safety valve and a hole for the steam pipe and sometimes a filler plug. It is held into the firebox by a screw soldered into one of the boiler's endcaps. You will notice it uses the same flywheel and safety valve as the vertical model. It was made between 1945 and 1956. There are a few of variations to this model. <br>  1.  The firebox opening at the funnel end could be square or round. Don't know when this change took place but do know of an engine with the square opening that was a Christmas present in 1948. The round ones also has an extra hole above it in the firebox to make it easier to tighten the nut that holds the boiler in place.<br>  2. It appears that this model came with or without a filler plug on top of the boiler. <br>  3. The firebox could come in red or black paint
