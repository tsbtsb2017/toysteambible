Notes:   The Crescent Horizontal Engine No.1 was Introduced in 1947. These engines were manufactured for Crescent Toys by C K Matsutoko of Japan.   The engine was not a commercial success, although cheap these engines were made from very thin, lightweight materials. There were also questions over the design of the burner which had a combined filler tube and handle. The burner was prone to catching fire and also tended to set the users hand alight! Only about 1000 were made, production ceasing in 1948.
