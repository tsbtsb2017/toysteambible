Notes:   This is a #204 engine, (22mm Bore x 25 stroke with 160mm flywheel), it is fitted with a 300mm x 150mm Boiler) with whistle, manometer, pressure gauge and single arm blow out control site glass. All brick Stenciling is original. Note also, three Pully line shaft in same color pattern and design. Entire piece is  27 3/8" x 17 3/4" or (648mm x 444mm) long by wide and weighs 14.5kgs.  It was made between 1908 and 1924. It was one of Wilhelm Bischoff's more Aesthetically pleasing plants. And very powerful. One drawback is I do not have original boiler and use a Josef Falk Triple burner which works well but takes the massive boiler 25 minutes to heat to steam at half capacity. This is a large And robust plant made by one of the early German masters who was once Dr. Oskar Schneiders Predecessor. In the mid thirties, Heinrich Rehse took over Wilhelm Bischoff's company and continued to use much of his castings to build very similar. If not the same engines.
