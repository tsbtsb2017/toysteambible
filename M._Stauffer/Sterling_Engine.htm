Notes:   I really don't have a lot of provenance on this piece other then the name clearly stamped into it's base and was told it was purchased in Germany about 1975. I was told it was used as a teaching aid and the gentleman I bought it from claimed the builder had a contract with various educational systems throughout The EU, to provide engineering classes and courses with a simple and robust little engine,  although I've never been able to confirm. <br><br>It's dimensions are 10" x 4 3/4" x 3 1/2". Flywheel is 3" in diameter and the Bore is 3/4" x Stroke 7/8" on power piston. 1" on Displacer rod.<br><br>The design is ingenious. The spirits tank is built into the base where it is filled through one filler cap while the wick sits directly under the displacer housing. A simple removal of the wick cap, light and watch it run.
