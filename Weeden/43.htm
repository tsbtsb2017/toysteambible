Notes:   <p>Has a thin sheet metal firebox.  The cylinder is single acting and made from a lead casting.  Similarly, the flywheel is a lead casting.  Just going from the OD of the cylinder, I would guess the bore to be close to 7/16’, and measuring from the center of the flywheel to the crank pin indicates a stroke of 5/8’.  </p> <p>The boiler is brass seamless tubing of approximately .032’ wall thickness.  The heating element is a cartridge type, and though only 250 watts, heats water to steam in just a few minutes.  The heating cartridge slips into a tube that is soldered lengthwise inside the boiler.  The cloth covered cord shows a UL listing on a pinch band fastened to the cord.  </p> <p>I did quite a bit of restoration work on this, including some boiler leaks, a new steam pipe, base sanding and refinishing. Although the firebox shows a few spots of paint loss, it was left in original condition, as I doubt I would be able to match the paint.   </p> <p>It's a very mild runner.  Kind of slow, maybe 600 rpm tops, and doesn't have a lot of power, but it is quite relaxing as it runs very smooth and quiet, and will happily run for as long as you care to keep filling the boiler. I think the stack on this one is slightly short.  Maybe would have been about an inch longer, originally. </p>
