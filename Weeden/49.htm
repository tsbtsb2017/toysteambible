Notes:   A large toy engine with a over sized brass boiler that is nickel plated.  There were variations of the engine which included a nickel plated base but others had a painted base of various colors.  The firebox and chimney are blued steel in which they made a two door model and a single door model which had the burner attached to the door.  Earlier models had two doors on the firebox and a lead whistle and safety valve.  This engine is considered scarce in any condition.  The 49 was made from 1898 at a cost of $5.00 until 1926 costing $7.00.
