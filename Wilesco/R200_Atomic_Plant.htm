Notes:   Wilesco ran production of these steam engines for a few years. These were available in stores in the period between 1958 and 1968 with very low sales, due to the fact that people was scared of anything with the word 'Atomic' on it, as it was associated with the Atomic Bomb. The Cold War was raging on during those days, the 'Missile Crisis', the Berlin Wall and the arms race between the East and West was the note of the day. Shelters, to survive atomic attacks, were being built in the USA and Europe in preparation for war, in fact, we were this close to have one!  There was nothing wrong, in terms of functionality, safety or quality with this steam engine. It just came out, to the market, on the wrong period in history, so Wilesco quit producing them in short time. Atomic Energy proved to be unpopular at the time.  As of today, they are very scarce and difficult to find in good condition. Usually these are very expensive.  Electrically heated by coil system: 220 VAC for Europe. 115 VAC export versions, like the one shown here, were also manufactured.  Power consumption: 250 Watts.   Steam Engine is based on the Wilesco D10 platform - Stroke 16 mm - Diameter 9 mm - Flywheel 70 mm.
