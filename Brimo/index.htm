<h1>Brimo History</h1>

<p>
Brimo engines were made by Brian Moss in Glenfield Auckland NZ and then in South Dunedin. In the North Island they were sometimes sold under the name 'Charles Stevenson' engines. Brimo engines were made in the 1960s and 1970s.  Brain was a tool and die maker by trade who retired and then made steam engines in the garage under his house.  All of the engine components were made by Brian and he adapted his equipment to suit each part's manufacturing requirements.
