He has been making engines for many years, mainly based on his own design.

Luckily he was able to work on this and has been able to continue to make the engines as beautifully as ever.  As he is unable to work full time it has become skill to keep his brain challenged and allow him to earn some extra funds.

Through his dealings he came to meet the owner of the ""Youth's  Companion""  magazine where they struck up a deal to produce toy steam engines to give away as premiums for his magazine.  The engine that Weeden produced was the Weeden No.1 which was priced at $1.00 and held a patent date of May 19, 1885, and  manufactured up to 1905.  Other products he made was comb cases, match safes and the Weeden Magic Lantern."

At this time was the 'glory' days as steam was the power source in factories and heavy equipment.   This gave a direct relationship kids could see how power was produced."
		
		s = s & "<br><br>In the early years the engine was run exclusively on wood alcohol with exception of the N0.20 which could also be run on kerosene or heating oil as well as alcohol. In 1926-27 electric heat was introduced on some engines and in the same period, various models were fitted with electric heat and given new model numbers.  By 1940 there were at least 110 different steam engines that Weeden had produced."

The new owners trimmed the  product line down to six engines and only two heated with alcohol.  1952 was the last of the Weeden company.   Behind the 110+ different models, plus other Weeden toys, Weeden left a memorable legacy."

Well, I can tell that the first engine called only 'unknown' is a modified Jensen style 45 just like the one I submitted months ago. All electric material has been removed, leaving only the boiler, crank, flywheel and piston. They modified the AC cable connector opening by widening it a lot in order to accept a burner. With the electric heater removed, you can use the empty space to put a burner in there and use it as a heat source. The Jensen 45 engine is a normal oscillating cylinder vertical boiler engine. Yes, it will run perfectly. They did a color change to green. Looks nice though. Too bad there is no picture of the other side (as the sight glass is in there but can not be seen in the picture). The whistle and SV have the same thread (like in all Jensens) and can be swapped. In this case, you can see that the SV is using the normal position where the whistle should go and vice-verse. One last thing I can say is that this unknown engine is not made of brass. It is a Jensen 45 with a boiler made of steel which are much more common. You can test it with a magnet. The smoke stack is an original Jensen one but painted in a different color. Please take a look at my pictures of my Jensen 45 you have in your site to compare. Mine has got a brass boiler so it has rivets holding together the steel firebox (where the electric heater is located) and the brass boiler. Regarding year of manufacture: Jensen made the 45 from 1952 to 1955. During the Korean war, brass was scarce as it was used for ammo shells. During the first years of the war, Jensen made them with brass boilers. Later, Mr. Jensen sr. started to use steel and no more brass was available. Steel versions of this engine are very common. Brass ones are very rare. Steel, heat and water is not a good combination. This engines use to fail quickly as they rusted inside and pin holes started to develop inside the bottom of the boiler. Water the will go into the heater rendering unusable and unsafe. For sure this is what happened to this engine and the owner modified it to use a meths burner and keep using it. Very clever modification. <br><br> 27Ace27 also offers the same opinion: The first unknown engine in the unknown manufacturers page on you site is a repainted Jensen 45 that has had the heater removed, and a hole cut in the firebox for a burner.

Both boilers are approximately 6 3/4 inches long and 2 1/2 inches in diameter, though engine #1 has a thicker cap on the sight glass end. Both have a smooth finish on the back side of the boiler with no cap. Both measure 6 3/4 inches tall from the bottom of the base to the top of the stack.   Both have the pressure relief valve located in the stack.  Some of the major differences between the two are as follows:  Whistle placement, on #1 is towards the back of the boiler just in front of the stack, where as on engine #2 it is centered between the flue and steam regulating valve.   The whistles are just under 2 inches tall. #1 has a flat top where #2 is domed there are also other minor changes between the two.  Throttle knobs on both engines are made of red ""Bakelite"" but each has a different design. #2 having more of a mushroom shape.  Engine #1 has a round piston rod connected to the flywheel that pivots at the piston. #2 has a flat connecting rod from the flywheel that connects to the piston rod and there is a dome on the cylinder where the rod enters the piston.
