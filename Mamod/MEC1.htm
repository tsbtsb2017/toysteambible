Notes:   The MEC1 was introduced when Meccano requested Mamod to construct an engine specially designed to drive Meccano models, it was branded with the Meccano logo instead of the Mamod loco.  After Mamod's agreement with Meccano ended the model was rebranded the Mamod SP3 and a sight glass and whistle were added.  <br>Unusally the water plug on this example was drilled at the wrong end.

Notes:   This was my first steam engine, obtained as a wreck at a swap meet for AU$30, with no crankshaft, flywheel or level plug, but the boiler and cylinderwere basically intact, but the cylinder was siezed and part of the con-rod was missing. A couple of days later, it was up and running, but with no burner, we used a gas torch for heat, so we tried candles as a fuel to keep the boiler hot, with the gas torch used to raise steam. We then used metho, but the burner we made was poorly designed and often spilt burning metho on the ground. The burner was then converted to use Hexi tablets (Esbit), which has been quite a sucess. I now have a proper Mamod vap burner which I will use in it.
