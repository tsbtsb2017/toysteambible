		<h2>How to submit engines to the Toy Steam Bible </h2>
		<table width='100%'>

<p>If anyone would like to send in some more engines for the bible,  particularly ones that aren't on the site already, here's how: </p>

<p>Send an email to <a href='mailto:subtsb@gmail.com'>subtsb@gmail.com</a> containing the following information: </p>
<p></p>
<pre>Engine Manufacturer:
Engine Model:
Engine Approximate Date:        (If known)
Your name:                      (How you want to appear on the site) 
Your website:                   (If any, it's good advertising!) 
Notes:                          (Any comments you have about the engine) </pre>
<p></p>
<p>Then attach one or more photos.  It helps me if you can send images sized at 800x600,  but I will resize them if necessary. </p>
<p>If you can send a separate email per engine submission that helps me too.  I try and get them updated to the site within a week (I do have a day job!). 
I'll let you know when I recieve your submission so you know it hasn't been lost.</p>
<p>I do ask that you own the engine in question (or have permission of the owner to show it on the site). </p>
<p>I reserve the right to reject or edit any submissons as I think fit. :-) </p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>Michael</p>
